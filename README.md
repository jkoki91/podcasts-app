# Podcast aplication by Jore Lleonart

The application consists of two directories, one for the frontend, and another for a small backend that only serves to avoid the cors error in the requests.

##Â How to start 

First you have to go to the root folder of the project and run the following commands in the terminal:

```
    cd cors-anywhere
    npm install
    npm start
```

Once the cors-anywhere application has started, we will return to the root folder of the project and run the following commands in the terminal:

```
    cd podcasts
    npm install
    npm start
```
